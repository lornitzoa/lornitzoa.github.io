# Unit 1 Project: Basic Nutrition NutritionTracker

## Summary
This application will allow a user to search for foods and add them to meals each day and then track specific nutritional elements and total caloric intake per meal and per day.

## Approach and Background
My design is particularly shaped by the MyFitnessPal meal tracking application.

## Further Development
Ultimately I want get an API to a FODMAP database where I can cross reference selected foods and also return FODMAP information. The purpose being to enable those on a FODMAP diet to track both their FODMAP intake along with their macro nutritional intake. I would also develop functionality for logging reactions to various foods so people could identify which FODMAPs they are sensitive to and which they are able to tolerate. This would be a particularly useful tool both in the elimination phase of the diet as well as the maintenance of it.

- **NOTE: I struggled with the drag and drop function for a few hours. I was able to get the first drag and drop to work from the initial meal to the second. I had trouble getting the second move to occur while still seeing the element. I also had a lot of positioning issues. While I searched through quite a few sources for answers I figured out the solution that worked for me on my own through trial and error and so am not siting many sources for my final solution.
